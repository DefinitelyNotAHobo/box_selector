## Box Selector

The purpose of this repo is to develop a program that can reference an inventory of boxes to find the most efficient box size for an inputted product size. Format will be length, width, height. Units will be in inches.

Will possibly include a millimeter to inch converter since most automotive parts are developed in the metric system, while packaging is imperial.
